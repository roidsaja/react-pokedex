# react-pokedex

Spare time project for experimenting and playing around with React Hooks API and its concepts, which can be seen [here](https://reactjs.org/docs). 
I've somewhat done some explanation [here](https://dev.to/okroid/pokedex-with-react-364d), feel free to contribute and give it a star :smile:
