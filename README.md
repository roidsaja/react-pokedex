Spare time project for experimenting and playing around with React Hooks API and its concepts, which can be seen [here](https://reactjs.org/docs). 

### TODO:
* Implement a search bar function for a specific pokemon.
* Optimize code further into component folders.
* Explain what I did in a blog or some sort.
